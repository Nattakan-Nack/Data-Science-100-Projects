# 100 Data Science Projects

Welcome to my repository of **100 Data Science Projects**, where I progressively build projects from **Beginner** to **Advanced** levels. This collection covers a wide range of topics, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and deep learning.

Each project is designed to help you understand and apply various concepts in Data Science. Feel free to explore and use any of these projects for learning or reference!
